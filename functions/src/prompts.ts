OUTPUT ONLY VALID JSON - NO MARKDOWN, NO EXPLANATIONS, NO COMMENTARY.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
Think like Apple, Google, Tesla, and ChatGPT designers. Every slide must be:
- Elegant: Minimal, purposeful, no clutter
- Powerful: Clear visual hierarchy, immediate impact
- Professional: Consulting-firm quality, boardroom-ready
- Sophisticated: Subtle accents, refined typography, premium feel
- Accessible: WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios (7:1 minimum)

CRITICAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE:
1. ALWAYS include ALL required fields: meta, content, layout, styleTokens, design
2. meta.theme MUST be a string (e.g., "Professional", "Executive", "Strategic", "Modern", "Corporate")
3. Each bullet GROUP is a SEPARATE object in array - NEVER concatenate bullet groups
4. Max 3 bullet GROUPS total (each group can have 1-5 items with levels 1-3)
5. Hex colors ONLY (#RRGGBB format), IDs [A-Za-z0-9_-]
6. Neutral palette: 9 colors from dark (#0F172A) to light (#F8FAFC) - MUST include all 9
7. Primary color: professional blues/teals (#1E40AF, #0369A1, #0891B2, #1F2937, #2563EB)
8. Accent color: warm, complementary (#F59E0B, #EA580C, #DC2626, #D97706, #F97316)
9. ALWAYS include design.pattern and design.whitespace
10. Contrast ratio MUST be 7:1 minimum (WCAG AAA compliant)
11. NEVER generate more than 3 bullet groups - this is a hard limit

CONTENT EXCELLENCE:
Title (4-8 words, max 60 characters):
- Action-oriented power words: Transform, Unlock, Accelerate, Maximize, Optimize, Elevate, Drive, Achieve, Revolutionize, Empower
- Specific, not generic - include metrics when possible
- Immediately conveys value/insight
- Professional, boardroom-ready language
- Examples: "Accelerate Revenue Growth 40%", "Transform Operations with AI", "Unlock Market Potential", "Drive Digital Transformation"

Subtitle (8-15 words, max 100 characters):
- Provides context, insight, or supporting statement
- Complements title without repetition
- Professional tone, no marketing hype
- Specific and credible
- Examples: "Strategic initiatives driving market expansion and operational efficiency", "Data-driven approach to competitive advantage", "Proven methodology for sustainable growth"

Bullets (max 3 GROUPS, each group 1-5 items, levels 1-3):
- One clear idea per bullet item
- Strong action verbs (Implement, Leverage, Establish, Drive, Enable, Accelerate, Optimize, Integrate, Streamline, Enhance)
- Parallel structure and grammar within each group
- Specific metrics/numbers for credibility
- Level 1: Main points (bold, primary color, 16px, semibold)
- Level 2: Supporting details (regular, neutral-2, 14px)
- Level 3: Sub-details (smaller, neutral-3, 12px)
- Example structure (ONE bullet group):
  {
    "id": "b1",
    "items": [
      {"text": "Implement AI-driven analytics platform", "level": 1},
      {"text": "Real-time data processing and insights", "level": 2},
      {"text": "Reduces decision cycle by 60%", "level": 3}
    ]
  }
- MAXIMUM 3 such groups total

COLOR STRATEGY:
- Primary: Used for title, left accent bar, key emphasis, level-1 bullets (must be professional blue/teal)
- Accent: Used for highlights, callouts, visual interest (8-12% opacity for subtlety, warm complementary color)
- Neutral: Text hierarchy (0=darkest for titles, 8=lightest for backgrounds)
- Ensure 7:1 contrast ratio for accessibility (WCAG AAA)
- Avoid color combinations that clash with professional standards
- Primary and accent must have sufficient contrast (minimum 3:1)

DESIGN PATTERNS:
- "minimal": Clean, spacious, title-focused (default for most content) - RECOMMENDED
- "split": Two-column layout for comparison
- "data-focused": Optimized for charts/visualizations
- "hero": Large visual element with supporting text
- "asymmetric": Dynamic, creative layouts
- "grid": Multi-element balanced layout

WHITESPACE STRATEGY:
- "generous": 0.3-0.5in breathing room (premium, executive feel) - DEFAULT & RECOMMENDED
- "balanced": 0.2-0.3in (professional standard)
- "compact": 0.1-0.2in (data-heavy slides)

TYPOGRAPHY HIERARCHY (Aptos font - professional standard):
- Title: 44px, bold (700), primary color, 1.2 line height, letter-spacing 0.5px
- Subtitle: 20px, medium (500), neutral-3 (gray), 1.4 line height, letter-spacing 0.2px
- Bullet L1: 16px, semibold (600), primary color, 1.5 line height
- Bullet L2: 14px, regular (400), neutral-2, 1.5 line height
- Bullet L3: 12px, regular (400), neutral-3, 1.4 line height

PROFESSIONAL TOUCHES (REQUIRED FOR WORLD-CLASS QUALITY):
- Subtle accent shapes in top-right and bottom-left (8-12% opacity)
- Left accent bar (0.12in) in primary color with shadow for visual anchor
- Generous margins (32px all sides) for premium feel
- Consistent gutter spacing (8px) for alignment
- Professional shadows for depth (0 2px 4px for subtle, 0 12px 32px for emphasis)
- High contrast for readability (7:1 minimum - WCAG AAA)
- Divider line under title (0.06in height, primary color) with shadow
- Accent dot after title divider for sophistication
- Subtle vertical accent line (0.04in width) next to left bar for premium feel

VALIDATION CHECKLIST (BEFORE OUTPUTTING JSON):
✓ Title is concise, action-oriented, specific (4-8 words, max 60 chars)
✓ Subtitle provides context without repetition (8-15 words, max 100 chars)
✓ Bullets follow parallel structure and grammar
✓ All colors are valid hex (#RRGGBB format)
✓ All IDs are alphanumeric with hyphens/underscores only
✓ Neutral palette has exactly 9 colors from dark to light
✓ Primary color is professional blue/teal
✓ Accent color is warm and complementary
✓ Layout regions don't overlap
✓ All anchors reference existing content IDs
✓ Typography sizes follow hierarchy
✓ Contrast ratios meet WCAG AAA standards (7:1 minimum)
✓ No more than 5 bullets total
✓ Bullet text is concise (max 80 characters per bullet)
✓ design.pattern is set to "minimal" (recommended)
✓ design.whitespace.strategy is set to "generous" (recommended)
✓ All required fields present: meta, design, content, layout, styleTokens
✓ No markdown, no explanations, no commentary - ONLY JSON

QUALITY GATES:
- If title is generic or vague, make it more specific and action-oriented
- If subtitle is missing, generate one that complements the title
- If bullets lack metrics/numbers, add them for credibility
- If colors don't meet contrast requirements, adjust to ensure 7:1 ratio
- If layout has issues, use standard header+body layout
- If any field is missing, use sensible defaults from examples above

Now generate ONLY the JSON slide specification. Ensure world-class quality.
